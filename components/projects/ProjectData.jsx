          my knowledge of these technologies. While I&apos;ve done a fair bit of
          React development prior, this was my first major fullstack app using
          MongoDB, Express, and Node, so it was a great learning experience, and
          I can now say I&apos;m very comfortable with this tech stack. The
          project also taught me about several other important topics like JWT
          authorization, password hashing, and file upload/storage on a backend.

          Gun Time is a first-person platformer game with shooter and puzzler
          aspects. The player breaks into a facility to steal the Time Gun,
          which allows them to speed up or slow down time for whatever they
          shoot. The player must use the gun&apos;s powers on enemies and the
          environment to solve puzzles, and escape the facility alive.
        </p>
        <p>
          The game features seven levels, two enemy types, several types of
          interactive environmental objects, complex mechanics, and cool
          physics, all of which lead to tons of fun gameplay! It also
          incorporates sound effects, music, settings, home and pause screens,
          and much more.

          Rather than using a template for my portfolio website, I decided to
          build it from scratch in order to improve my React and CSS skills. I
          tried to rely on dependencies as little as possible (other than for
          things like icons), so all components in this project were built
          completely from scratch by myself. The site is also fully responsive,
          and mobile-compatible.
        </p>
        <p>
          I learned a lot of neat CSS techniques while building this website
          &ndash; I had mostly used CSS frameworks like Tailwind and PrimeNG in
          the past, so writing it all from scratch with Sass was a big change!
          Building this website also taught me about how to create cool,
          reusable components like{' '}
          <InlineLink href="#personal-projects" local={true}>
            these links
          </InlineLink>
          , and how to approach creating larger, more complex components from
          scratch. I&apos;m especially proud of how the{' '}

          components turned out!

          I plan on keeping the site updated with new projects and work
          experience as I grow in my career, so stay tuned!
