# Personal Portfolio Website

Every software developer worth their salt needs to have a personal website, so here's mine.

Rather than using a template, I decided to build my own website from scratch in order to practice my React and CSS skills. I tried to rely on dependencies as little as possible (other than for things like icons), so all components in this project were built completely from scratch by myself. Aside from a few CSS tricks I picked up off of some blog posts and StackOverflow, the code was written 100% by me.

Feel free to use this repo as a reference for your own websites, but I would appreciate some credit if you decide to yoink any of the code :)
