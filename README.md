# Personal Portfolio Website

Every software developer worth their salt needs to have a personal website, so here's mine.

Rather than using a template for my portfolio website, I decided to build it from scratch in order to improve my React and CSS skills. I tried to rely on dependencies as little as possible (other than for things like icons), so all components in this project were built completely from scratch by myself.

I learned a lot of neat CSS techniques while building this website â€“ I had mostly used CSS frameworks like Tailwind and PrimeNG in the past, so writing it all from scratch with Sass was a big change! Building this website also taught me about how to create cool, reusable components like these links, as how to approach creating larger, more complex components from scratch. I'm especially proud of how the [work experience](https://github.com/carterjmoore/personal-website/tree/main/components/work) and [personal projects](https://github.com/carterjmoore/personal-website/tree/main/components/projects) components turned out!

I plan on keeping the site updated with new projects and work experience as I grow in my career, so stay tuned!

Feel free to use this repo as a reference for your own websites, but I would appreciate some credit if you decide to use any of the code :)
